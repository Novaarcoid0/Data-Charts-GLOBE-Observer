# Data-Charts-GLOBE-Observer
This repo will include the charts that I created for helping me predict locations with more Mosquitoes based on temperature, land over, and Mosquito Habitat observations from the Globe app.
The code was made during the EMERGE Data Hackathon at UF on January 31, 2026. I used Google Colab to create the code.
